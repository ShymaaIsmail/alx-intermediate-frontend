Here's a **general-purpose README.md** file for your `0x04-TypeScript` project that is **not task-oriented**, but still conveys professionalism and clarity, suitable for a portfolio or team project presentation:

# 0x04-TypeScript

This project explores the core features and capabilities of **TypeScript**, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. The goal is to build familiarity with TypeScript syntax, its advantages over vanilla JavaScript, and how it integrates into frontend development workflows using Webpack and ESLint.

## 📘 Overview

The project demonstrates practical TypeScript concepts such as:

* Static typing
* Interfaces and classes
* Working with the DOM using TypeScript
* Function typing
* Advanced types including generics and literal types
* Modules, namespaces, and declaration merging
* Using ambient namespaces and external libraries
* Class-based architecture and interfaces for real-world use cases

The setup is aligned with modern frontend tooling using **Webpack**, **Jest**, and **ESLint**, mimicking production-ready development environments.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **TypeScript** – For writing scalable, typed JavaScript
* **Webpack** – Module bundler for compiling and packaging code
* **Jest** – Testing framework for TypeScript and JavaScript
* **ESLint** – Ensures code quality and consistency

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* Understand and implement basic and advanced TypeScript types
* Build and extend custom interfaces and classes
* Leverage TypeScript to catch bugs early and improve code quality
* Configure a TypeScript development environment with build and linting tools
* Work with external JavaScript libraries using ambient declarations

## ✅ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build project**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run tests**

   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

> Note: Each `task_x` directory includes its own `main.ts` source file. You can run Webpack to bundle the code and test the output as needed.
